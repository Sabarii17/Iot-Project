# Clap-Controlled Light

This Arduino project allows a light to be turned ON/OFF by detecting claps using a sound sensor and controlling an AC lamp through a relay.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Sound Sensor (microphone module)
- Relay Module
- AC Bulb (or LED for testing)
- Jumper Wires

## Working
The sound sensor detects a clap sound and sends a signal to the Arduino, which then toggles the relay to switch the light ON or OFF.

## Future Scope
- Add double-clap vs. single-clap functionality
- Use with Wi-Fi (ESP8266) for remote control
